### Technical Documentation for Compost Analysis App

#### Overview
This document provides a detailed technical description of the compost analysis app designed using React Native. The app is capable of scanning and detecting objects, suggesting compost based on the detected objects using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and analyzing whether the compost is good or unhealthy. The backend leverages Google Vertex AI for machine learning models and FastAPI for integration.

### 1. Introduction
The compost analysis app assists users in identifying objects suitable for composting, providing suggestions, and assessing the quality of the compost. It leverages machine learning models to provide accurate detections and recommendations.

### 2. Architecture Overview
The application architecture comprises the following components:
- *Frontend*: Developed using React Native.
- *Backend*: Implemented with FastAPI, interfacing with Google Vertex AI models.
- *Machine Learning Models*: Trained and deployed using Google Vertex AI.

### 3. Frontend Implementation
#### React Native Components
- *Scanner Component*: Uses the camera to capture images.
- *Detection Result Component*: Displays detected objects and suggestions.
- *Analysis Result Component*: Shows the health status of the compost.

#### User Interface
- *Home Screen*: Entry point with options to scan and analyze.
- *Scan Screen*: Camera interface for capturing images.
- *Results Screen*: Displays detection and analysis results.

#### Interaction Flow
1. User accesses the scan feature.
2. Captured image is sent to the backend for object detection.
3. Detected objects are displayed with compost suggestions.
4. User can analyze the compost for health status.

### 4. Backend Implementation
#### FastAPI Endpoints
- */scan*: Accepts image input, triggers object detection.
- */suggest*: Provides compost suggestions based on detected objects.
- */analyze*: Analyzes the compost quality.

### 5. Machine Learning Models
#### Object Detection Model
- Trained using Google Vertex AI AutoML.
- Identifies compostable objects in the captured image.

#### Classification Model
- Determines the health status of the compost.
- Trained with labeled data indicating good and unhealthy compost samples.

#### NLP Model for Compost Suggestions
- Suggests appropriate composting methods based on detected objects.

### 6. Integration with Google Vertex AI
#### Model Training
- *Object Detection*: AutoML training using a labeled dataset of compostable items.
- *Classification*: Supervised learning with a dataset of compost health indicators.

#### Endpoint Deployment
- Models deployed to Google Vertex AI endpoints.
- Integrated with FastAPI for real-time inference.

### 7. Data Flow and Communication
- User captures an image using the app.
- Image is sent to the FastAPI backend.
- Backend forwards the image to the object detection model endpoint.
- Detected objects are processed, and compost suggestions are generated.
- User selects compost items for health analysis.
- Classification model determines compost health status.
- Results are sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

### 8. Security and Privacy
- Secure communication using HTTPS.
- User data anonymized before processing.
- Data stored and processed following GDPR and other relevant regulations.

### 9. Testing and Validation
- Unit tests for frontend components.
- Integration tests for FastAPI endpoints.
- Model accuracy validation with a separate test dataset.

### 10. Future Enhancements
- Enhanced NLP for more accurate suggestions.
- Expansion of the object detection model to recognize a wider variety of compostable items.
- User feedback loop to continuously improve model accuracy.
